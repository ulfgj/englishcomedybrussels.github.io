It looks like his show is going to be about political satire !

Will Durst (USA)
Acknowledged by peers and press alike as one of the premier political satirists in the country, Will Durst has patched together a comedy quilt of a career, weaving together columns, books, radio and television commentaries, acting, voice overs and most especially, stand up comedy, into a hilarious patchwork of outraged and outrageous common sense. His abiding motto is “You can’t make stuff up like this."

Andy Valvur (USA)
Well acquainted with the Brussels crowd, and with european politics. Andy has already performed several times at our comedy nights. He has estonian origins, lives in Cologne & San Francisco, he's one of our crowd's favorites.

Don't pass on this show, a must for all those who want to see politics on its funnier and lighter side.
