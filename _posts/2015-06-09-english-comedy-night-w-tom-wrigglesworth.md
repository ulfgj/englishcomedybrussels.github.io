Welcome to another great Comedy night in Brussels, here's the lineup :

### Tom Wrigglesworth (GB)
Tom is an established Stand-Up comedian, Radio and TV presenter and voice-over artist from Sheffield, England.

With a disarmingly charming delivery and unforgettable appearance, this Yorkshire funny man became a national have-a-go-hero when he rescued a little old lady from the jaws of a Virgin train ticket inspector; only to be arrested for begging. His subsequent story of the event secured Tom several awards including the Chortle Best Show Award, and a nomination for the main Edinburgh Comedy Award.

This led to a sell out tour of the UK, and runs at the New Zealand Comedy Festival and prestigious Montreal Comedy Festival.

Following this, Tom recorded two series of ‘Tom Wrigglesworth’s Open Letters’ for BBC Radio 4, tackling consumer issues in his own hilarious way and winning a highly acclaimed Sony Award for best Radio Comedy along the way.

### Archie Maddocks (GB)
He’s an exciting and award winning Stand Up Comedian, who is armed with a natural stage presence, and a “winning smile”. He possesses an affable and likeable nature that immediately puts people at ease and has impressed both his peers and audiences with his charismatic, conversational style, hilarious observations and quick, acerbic wit.
