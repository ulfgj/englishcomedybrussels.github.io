What a line-up again for this show! Al Lubel & Michael Fabbri are back.  If you're new to our comedy nights then you definitely need to check this one out.  Two opposing styles of comedy, with two masters of their skill.
 
## Al Lubel
 
Al Lubel became a lawyer to satisfy his mother and quit to become a comedian to satisfy his sadistic need to torture her. After graduating law school in Florida, Al moved to California, passed the bar exam on his first try and immediately began the practice of standup comedy.

Al practiced law during the day and comedy at night. Getting stage time is hard for a beginning comic, so Al would sometimes suddenly stand up in the middle of Denny's, and unannounced, do five minutes. And Al always did well because he had everyone's rapt attention because people were scared he might hurt them!

Al gradually improved at comedy, getting work on the road and leaving the law behind. Within a year he won the $100,000 Comedy Grand Prize on Star Search. Doing the Tonight Show was a big childhood fantasy, so Al auditioned and became one of the last comics to appear with Johnny Carson. Al went on to do six more Tonight Show appearances with Jay Leno and made five appearances on the Late Show with David Letterman.

## Michael Fabbri
