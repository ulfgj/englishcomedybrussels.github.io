Rayguns Look Real Enough are back in Brussels, and together with them our favorite Dutch comedian, Edo Berger.

# Rayguns Look Real Enough (GB)
Spinal Tap meets Morcambe and wise, with the comedy circuit's most unique double-act. The self proclaimed "World's Greatest Stadium Rock Band features Ray Gunn and Luke Reel as they reveal what it takes to be a Rock 'n' Roll Superstar. Combining character comedy with high energy musical mash-ups, Rayguns Look Real Enough are not to be missed."

"My favourite opening act" - Steve O - Jackass

"Fast and Funny" - The List"The British answer to Tenacious D but way funnier" - Broadway Baby

"A big hit" - The Sun

# Edo Berger
Edo Berger hails from Amsterdam. Edo eats everything and loves children. His favourite primary colours are red, yellow and blue.Edo Berger won several Dutch comedy festivals before expanding to performing in English. He also does a weekly musical radio column and made a documentary about the comedian’s love for anecdotes about horrible comedy gigs, called Dictator of Comedy.

The first time he performed at our club he litterally stole the show and the audience immediately requested that he comes back.  Since then he's become a regular to our comedy nights. If you haven't seen him in action, this is your chance!

Doors open at 6:30 pm, come early and enjoy some great food and spectacular Gin & Tonics!
