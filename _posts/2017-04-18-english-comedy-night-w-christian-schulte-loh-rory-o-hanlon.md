Another one of our favorite acts is back, Christian Schulte-Loh!!

## Christian Shulte-Loh (Ger)

Normally it's not a good sign when a German steps on stage. It either ends in a world domination speech or in a Europop performance. Both cases have scared off generations and created a very well known stereotype:  
Germans are not funny - at least not on purpose.

Christian decided very early to change that stereotype. His first solo show ("Stop Laughing, I am German!") got excellent reviews and sell-out audiences at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2009.

"Christian Schulte-Loh has created one of the most subversive acts ever. The gags have an astonishing freshness and power." (The Spectator)

Christian has been gigging for The Comedy Store (UK), The SoHo Comedy Club (UK), Highlight (UK), MirthControl (UK), BudSuCS (Hungary), 123ComedyClub (Belgium/Holland) and many more.
 
## Rory O’Hanlon (Ire)
 
Rory O'Hanlon is one of the rising stars of Irish and UK comedy, starting off his comedy career in Dublin, Rory is now a firm favourite at every top comedy venue in the UK and Ireland. Rory machine gun style punchlines has audiences crying with laughter. Just back from another hugely successful run at the Edinburgh fringe the future looks bright for this brilliant comedian.
