Oyez Oyez, watch out for this show because we are unleashing the tiger once again in Brussels.  If you don't know what I mean, see below and book asap, because this will be a show to remember with award winning comedian Nathan Caton together with probably the most unique experience of comedy that you may experience, as well as one of the most succesful acts we ever had in Brussels.... Rayguns Look Real Enough.

## Nathan Caton

Live At The Apollo, Mock The Week, Russell Howard’s Good News, BBC R4’s Can’t Tell Nathan Caton Nothing…

‘A comic well worth catching any chance you can’ – One4review

‘Funny, clever and a pleasure to listen to.’ – Broadway Baby

‘A charming and convincing operator’ – The List

Nathan Caton is one of the most exciting young comedians on the scene. Gigging since the tender age of 19, over the last decade he has established himself both as a circuit headliner, and a name on TV and radio.

Within his first few years on stage, he had picked up various accolades and coveted plaudits including the Chortle Student Comic of the Year award and Broadcast Hotshot and written and starred in a pilot for Paramount Comedy (now Comedy Central) entitled The Nathan Caton Show.

Since then Caton has gone from strength to strength, wowing audiences at comedy clubs up and down the UK, and on his numerous TV and radio appearances, with his delightfully charming blend of personal and political comedy.

## Rayguns Look Real Enough

One of the most unique double acts in the UK, combining high quality musicality and insane mash ups to deliver an unrivalled entertainment experience which brings together cabaret, comedy and rock n roll.

Rayguns Look Real Enough are a rock band on the edge.

But on the edge of what exactly? If only they knew.

Band memebers Ray Gunn and Luke Reel each have something to prove as rock and roll stars but their methods may not exactly be in the same book, let alone on the same page.

Will they ever achieve their goal to be inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame?

Doors open at 6:30 pm, come early and enjoy some great food and spectacular Gin & Tonics!

Online tickets : 17€  
On the door : 20€
