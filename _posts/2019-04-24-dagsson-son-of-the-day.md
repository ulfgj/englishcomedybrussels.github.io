Get ready for something big again at CaliClub with Hugleikur Dagsson!

## Hugleikur Dagsson

Hugleikur Dagsson was born in the winter of 1977 in the northern part of Iceland. Since then he has been breathing oxygen and eating sharks to fuel his artistic tendencies. He graduated from the Iceland Academy of the Arts in 2002 and is now an established comedian, cartoonist, screenwriter and director. He has published around 30 books, mostly comics or cartoon collections with focus on dark humor. Hugleikur Dagsson has written 3 plays, directed his own animated TV series and is also in a boyband.

He has been doing stand up comedy in Iceland for a decade and taped two stand up specials in Icelandic. His style has been described as "filthy but friendly". His material includes the weird sex taboos of Star Wars, the inescapable creepiness of Tinder and the tragic plight of gluten intolerants. After running out of Icelandic audiences, he is finally bringing his comedy style to the mainland in the English language. You have been warned.
