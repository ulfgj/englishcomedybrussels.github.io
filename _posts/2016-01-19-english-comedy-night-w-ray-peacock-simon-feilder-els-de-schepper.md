Another amazing line up for our second show this year. With two comedians coming to Brussels for the first time, and with none other than Belgian comedy star Els De Scheeper as a very special guest.

### Ray Peacock
Ray Peacock (#1 on iTunes with his Peacock & Gamble Podcast) has had an impressive comedy career, both as one half of the critically acclaimed double-act Peacock & Gamble, and as a solo writer, performer, actor and presenter. The loveably juvenile entertainer has established himself as one of the most popular compères, headline performers and TV warm-up acts on the circuit, garnering Chortle Comedy Award nominations in four successive years. He is contentedly resigned to never actually winning one.

_“Incessantly hilarious”_ &mdash; The Guardian

_"Aunrestrained silliness, uninhibited chidishness and the odd pratfall"_ &mdash; The Independent

_"Pure Gold"_ &mdash; The Guardian

_“A gloriously silly hour &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;”_ &mdash; Chortle

_“Combining the childish mischief of John Belushi with the victimised protestations of the underdog &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;”_ &mdash; The List

Along with being the only act to have made repeat appearances on Russell Howard's Good News (BBC Three), Ray's TV credits include No Heroics (ITV2), Doctor Who (BBC One), Skins (E4), Doctors (BBC One), Skin Deep (Channel 4), Not Going Out (BBC One), The Many Faces Of Les Dawson (BBC One) and Les Dawson's Finest Hour (Channel 4).

In 2007, Ray created The Ray Peacock Podcast which later became the hugely successful (#1 on iTunes) Peacock & Gamble Podcast. The show has been nominated for Chortle Comedy Awards in consecutive years, and is used as in-flight entertainment for British Airways. Ray also presented flagship shows on FUBAR radio, Some Nonsense with Ray Peacock, Peacock & Gamble, and Barnes & Peacock do Sex.


### Simon Feilder
Simon first burst onto our screens as the in-house weather presenter for Channels 4’s The Big Breakfast, where he swiftly graduated to fronting his own strand entitled Feilder's Dreams. This gave him the chance to; spend time with bands such as Aerosmith, The Offspring and even black metal gods Cradle of Filth; attend a dog wedding; feature in an episode of Friends in LA, and much much more...

Since diving headlong into the world of stand-up comedy, Simon has been a semi-finalist in the BBC New Comedy Awards, a finalist in the Amused Moose Talent Quest, Laughing Horse New Act, Bath New Act, Leicester New Act Competition and Jongleurs Comedy Callback. Always the bridesmaid.

_"Talented...slick...he hits the mark superbly. A must-see show &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;"_ &mdash; Broadway Baby

_"A delightful debut hour...Feilder is pretty fly for a self-deprecating white guy &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;"_ &mdash; Metro

_"Extremely slick...impressively creative &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;"_ &mdash; Three Weeks

_"Impish confidence, winning exuberance. Deceptively clever hour of self-deprecating comedy"_ &mdash; The List

### Els De Schepper
Els started in 1991 on Flemish TV. Through several soaps, game shows and its own shows, she became a star. Her heart, however, is not entirely on TV, but especially in the theatre.

Since 1993 she has created every 2 years a ‘one woman show’ that reached each time more than 80,000 spectators. She was the first comedian to create a show at the Lotto Arena in Antwerp for more than 4,500 spectators every evening.

Since 2011 she performs also in French (in Wallonia, France and Canada) and German.
Serious roles are also cut for her. She will play Edith Piaf in the musical in October 2015.
