A dream line-up for this show, with a very very special guest, Richard Ruben, who already performed all over France and Belgium, selling out the biggest venues. It'll be his first ever performance in EnglishFin Taylor

## Fin Taylor
Fin Taylor began performing stand-up whilst at Bristol University in January 2009. Since then he has established himself as a unique voice in the up-and-coming generation of new UK comics. He soon became professional and went on to tour support for Glenn Wool and Russell Howard and has made multiple appearances on Josh Widdicombe’s XFM show, as well as being one of the founding members of cult live show The Bearpit Podcast (Podcast). He also regularly warms up for BBC ONE’s “Pointless” hosted by Alexander Armstrong.

“Has all the makings of a world quality stand-up” – The List  
“Taylor is on the cusp of something big” – The Skinny  
“He’s found a prime vantage point for observational standup” – Fest  
“Highly rated up-and-comer” – The GuardianDarius Davies  
"Brilliant, hilarious, outstanding ★★★★★ " - Broadway Baby  

## Darius Davies
Back in 2007, Darius Davies began his comedy career gracing the stages of the open mic nights in New York. Pretty swiftly, his unique brand of high octane comedy got him noticed and he won an MTV New Talent contest; opening the door for Darius to strut his stuff on MTV America.

Darius was almost certain that this taste of stardom would lead to unrivalled fame in the UK, so he hopped overseas and in the blink of an eye (four years later) he found himself gigging regularly up and down the beautiful British Isles. With a particular style akin to a performance poet or faith healer, Darius commands his audience with wonderful charisma – an American style comedian with British soul.
He also has the best routine about electrical plugs you will ever hear.

‘A near faultless and original set, which would not look out of place on Live At The Apollo. Moreover, Davies has something to say’ ★★★★ - Scotsgay  
"A star to be" - Christian O'Connell, Absolute Radio  
"Amazing" - Russell Kane  
"Gold-plated garbage" – Chortle Richard Ruben  
“After 20 years of making Belgians and French laugh, Richard Ruben, the number 1 Belgian showman, jumps without aparachute into Stand-up comedy in English.  
He is a triple act (he talks, he sings and doesn’t understand what he is saying in English)  
A frenchy in love with big English speaking Cities.”
