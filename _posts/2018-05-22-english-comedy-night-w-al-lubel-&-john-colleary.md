Here's probably THE one show not to miss this season, with two mindblowing comedians, Al Lubel and John Colleary.
 
## Al Lubel (USA)
 
Winner of the Amused Moose Judges Prize for his 2013 Edinburgh show, yet one of the last comics to appear on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson (making six more appearances with Jay Leno and five appearances on the Late Show with David Letterman), Al Lubel is one of those rare beasts who garners both critical praise and mainstream success. He's supported Jerry Seinfeld, who kindly mentioned "Al has one of the best jokes I have ever heard" and recently fellow comic Adam Bloom gave him high praise by saying Al had "the most original first ten minutes of comedy I’ve ever seen."
 
Al’s solo show, Mentally Al, won the Amused Moose Award Judges Prize as the best one person show in the 2013 Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Two years later he was nominated for best performer of a solo show by the Barry Awards at the 2015 Edinburgh Fringe Festival.
 
"A terrifically funny comedian" David Letterman
"A cult superstar in the making" Bruce Dessau, Beyond the Joke/Evening Standard
"Al Lubel takes all of the attributes that gave his 2013 show such cult appeal and does more of them, marrying existential angst, metaphysical enquiry and lexical mischief for a performance quite unlike anyone else at the Fringe." Jay Richardson, Scotsman
  
## John Colleary (Ire)
 
John Colleary is star and co-writer of the 3-time IFTA nominated THE SAVAGE EYE. His credits include appearances on STAND AND DELIVER & THE PANEL (RTE2), as well as being the writer/performer of popular slot LAST ORDERS on TODAY FMs LAST WORD.  He is one of Dublin’s most sought after MC’s and comedians and also one of our crowd’s favorite acts.
Doors open at 6:30 pm, come early and enjoy some great food and spectacular Gin & Tonics!
