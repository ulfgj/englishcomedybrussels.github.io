It's a pleasure to have one of the most talented and acclaimed comedians on the circuit...  Yes, Glenn Wool is back in Brussels! 

## GLENN WOOL: Viva Forever

Fresh from a sold-out, critically acclaimed run at the Edinburgh Fringe, Glenn Wool (Freestyle with Frankie Boyle, The Comedians' Comedian's Comedians with Doug Stanhope) takes his hysterical new show chronicling his past two years on the road, which is interesting because... well, just come to the show. He'll tell you then. I mean, if you've read this far, just Google him and see if it’s your kind of thing.  (I can’t believe we still have to tell people about Google in this day and age, but there you go. I blame Trump.)

“One of the best comics in the business, go and see him now!” - CHORTLE ★★★★ 1/2

“An hour with Wool is worth about ten hours with many other comics.” - THE SCOTSMAN ★★★★

“Railing against political correctness in a sharp and intelligent manner”- THE SKINNY ★★★★

“An enjoyable set performed by a radiantly warm stand up who will make you feel like Christmas has come early” - BROADWAY BABY ★★★★

As special guest for this evening, another fantastic performer...
