Another brilliant line-up for this show!

### Chris Martin (GB)
Over the last years that Chris Martin supported Jack Whitehall (2011), Russell Kane (2012) & Milton Jones on his full tour for 2013.  
He performed a sold out run at Edinburgh Festival in 2011 for his show “Chris Martin: No, Not That One” & is doing his first solo tour in the spring of 2014.

### David Morgan (GB)
David did so well in August that I had many requests to get him back, so here he is!

‘A joy to behold’ &mdash; The Metro

David’s solo shows and his ability to make audiences ‘feel they’ve had a show performed specifically for them’ (London is Funny) cements him as a firm favorite in the industry. 

In August 2014, he took his current show ‘Social Tool’ to the Edinburgh Fringe for a full run. Broadway Baby said that “David Morgan’s greatest strength and what makes him such an enjoyable comedian to watch is his seemingly innate ability to interact and connect with his audience.”

Due to David’s brilliant skills, he was asked to host the special one-off charity show ‘Take A Comedian Out’ at the Pleasance Grand, to an audience of 750 with a total of 35 comedians taking part.
