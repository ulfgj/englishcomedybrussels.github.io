After a great performance in Brussels last year, we are glad to welcome back Chris Purchase, together with Harriet Dyer, one of the most sought after female acts on the circuit.

## Chris Purchase
Finalist for What’s On magazine’s Best Comedian 2016, 2017 and 2018,
Finalist out of 20,000 comedians for the Laugh Factory’s international joke of the year 2017
Hand-picked to support Reginald D. Hunter on tour
 
Chris is currently taking the comedy scene by storm with his mix of light hearted anecdotes and cultural satire. After going viral multiple times last year Chris’ popularity has rocketed. Chris is also massively popular with corporate clients including hosting Google’s European conferences.
 
“Charismatic and entertaining” Comedy Central
“Had the crowd roaring, lapped it up . Full of energy, loud, charismatic. Lovely.” The Stand
“Top stuff...confident, funny and self deprecating” Jack Whitehall
“Fantastic Set” Adam Bloom
"That is a nice tie" Reginald D Hunter
 
## Harriet Dyer
Harriet Dyer (as seen on ITV1, 2 and Be, BBC Live at The Fringe, BBC3 and as heard on Absolute Radio, BBC Radio 4 Extra, BBC Ouch, BBC Knock Knock) is a unique and exciting presence in comedy.
With heterodox tales of a misspent youth and an extremely original delivery, it’s easy to get swept up in Harriet’s menagerie of tomfoolery. Not something you forget in a hurry too.
