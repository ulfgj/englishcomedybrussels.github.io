We are back after summer break, and we are very happy to start the season with two comedians that'll perform in Brussels for the very first time, Will Mars & Sean Morley

##Will Mars
Brilliantly self-deprecating stand-up, Will Mars, is fast making a name for himself as a down-at-heel, yet lovable international star.

Top 50 Best One-Liners from the Edinburgh Fringe 2017: The Scotsman

Whilst living in New York for the past few years, the English Comedian of The Year Finalist, has earned notoriety from his peers and audiences alike in both live comedy clubs as well as on air where he made his TV debut on Fox’s Showtime at The Apollo.

"Damn that dude is funny!" Steve Harvey, Showtime at the Apollo (U.S.)

Will is also the creator and producer of the hit show, Joke Thieves. This is the hilariously funny improv-style show whereby Will challenges top comedians to perform their own jokes and then each other’s! This has been made into a pilot for BBC 2 and has toured across the world from the US to Australia.

“See comics deconstructing each other's acts...truly electric"★★★★ The Scotsman

"punctures an expectation and implies a whole bizarre reality in only 12 words" Brian Logan, The Guardian

"... no topic is taboo... a unique and witty perspective on thoughts that many have but rarely articulate" Adelaide Advertiser

"His fast-paced performance is refreshingly brutal" Ed Fringe Review

"Mars' pithy observations are sharp and on point" Broadway Baby

Finalist: NEW VARIETY LIVES (U.K.) NATY'S Awards 2018

Winner: CHORTLE AWARD (U.K.) Best Club Night, London 2015

Finalist: English Comedian of the Year Award 2014

##Sean Morley
Sean Morley is one of the most original voices on the UK circuit. A fresh, bold and absurd performer who is desperate to escape England and find friendship on the continent.  

As heard on BBC Radio 2, Radio 4 and 4 Extra.

"The sort of encounter you'll talk about for some time afterwards" Chortle

"Giddily hilarious. And he told not one joke" Vibrations Magazine 

"Setting the bar for alternative comedy" Our Favourite Places

Doors open at 6:30 pm, come early and enjoy some great food and spectacular Gin & Tonics!
