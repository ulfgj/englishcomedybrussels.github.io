Fabulous line up for our first February show, check this out !

## Isak Jansson (SWE)

Isak Jansson is one of Sweden’s top international comedy acts. He has spread Swedish comedy all over the world in places like Russia, India, South Africa, Finland, France, Germany, Belgium, UK, Estonia, China, etc.
His comedy style mixes observational comedy with an absurdist touch, all in a high energy physical stage persona. In 2013 he toured with his solo show "It´s the Flourist’s Fault".
He is truly one of the best acts we’ve had so far and we’re very happy to have him back in Brussels

## Angela Barnes (GB)

Since winning the BBC Radio 2's New Comedy Award 2011, Barnes has continued to be a regular on the stand-up circuit, playing even bigger venues. She has also appeared on Weekend Wogan’s Children in Need Special and Russel Kane’s Whistlestop Tour for Radio 2, written for Radio 4’s The News Quiz, played on Eddie Izzard’s Laughs in the Park on BBC Two, appeared on Russe Howard Good News on BBC Three, developed her own series with BBC Radio Comedy, and performed at the Latitude festival, the Edimburgh Festival Fringe and Radio 2 Live in Hyde Park.

“Brilliantly funny” &mdash; *Sarah Millican*  
“She’s just a gloriously down-to-earth, straight talking and extremely funny comic” &mdash; *The Guardian*  
“Angela Barnes is the best mainstream female comedian I’ve seen since Sarah Millican… I can’t be any clearer than that can I?” &mdash; *Bruce Dessau, Evening Standard critic*
