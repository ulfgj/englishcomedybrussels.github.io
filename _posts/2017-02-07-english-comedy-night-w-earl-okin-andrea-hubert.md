## Earl Okin

For years, Earl Okin has headlined under the byline ‘Musical Genius & Sex Symbol’
Earl has been a headline act on the unforgiving UK alternative comedy circuit for decades, highly respected by all his fellow performers, young and old.

He began, however, at the Comic Strip, alongside, Rik Mayall, French & Saunders, Nigel Planer et al.

Among his admirers are such names as Billy Connolly,Sacha Baron Cohen and Eddie Izzard
(at whose clubs Earl headlined when they were both starting out).
Earl has probably performed more ‘encores’ than just about anyone around and his blend of comedy and music (Tom Lehrer was one of his influences) is in demand literally around the world.

Earl has performed at such festivals as Juste Pour Rire in Montreal, the Adelaide Fringe in Australia and Humorologie in Belgium with equal success.
He regularly performs in Sweden, Germany, Austria and Holland…
and at such famous US clubs as The Comedy Store, Caroline’s, The Improv. and The Ice House.

Last but not least, Earl is in high demand for both corporate and private parties, having entertained not only Queen Elizabeth II but the king and queen of Sweden, too.

As with everything else he does, Earl Okin’s comedy is unique!

## Andrea Hubert

Andrea Hubert started out on the comedy circuit in late 2009, and within 20 gigs gained second place in a national competition. She’s since performed alongside some of the UK’s best comedians at prestigious comedy clubs all over the UK, been commissioned as a writer for a BBC pilot and was shortlisted for the BAFTA Rocliffe New Writing Forum at the New York Television Festival 2012.  She was dubbed One to Watch in 2012 by London is Funny, for whom she went on to write a comedy poetry blog in 2012.

In 2013, Andrea and her writing partner Ryan Cull won the prestigious BAFTA Rocliffe New Writing Forum competition, beating over 500 other entrants. The writing pair are currently working on a new sitcom as part of a development deal with Objective Productions (makers of Peep Show and Fresh Meat.) She is also producing a book of short plays, and continues to contribute regular interviews and features to The Guardian.
