For our July Comedy Night, we are very pleased to have Scott Capurro headlining at the Black Sheep. With him our beloved Manu Moreau, and also the first appearance of Sergej Lopouchanski at our Comedy Night.

## Scott Capurro
Scott is a veteran of our TV screens. A diverse performer (read: difficult), Scott’s talents were also incorporated into various films, when he was young and film worthy.  
He performed in:  
MRS. DOUBTFIRE, dir: Chris Columbus, 20 Century Fox, ‘Aunt Jack’  
STAR WARS; PHANTOM MENACE, dir: George Lucas, Star Wars Films, ‘Beed’

His TV work is way too long to put in here, but he’s appeared as a guest, a presenter, or a reviewer on Channel 5, BBC 1 & 2, ITV, SKY 1, Comedy Central, NBC...

Scott regularly plays almost every comedy club in the English speaking world, including the Punchline in San Francisco, the Comedy Store in London, the Comic Strip in New York City, and Yuk Yuks in Toronto, Canada.

Also an experienced actor/director, Scott trained at UC Irvine, California, where he received a bachelors degree; and in the UK at Birmingham University. Credits include performances with the following companies/theatres &mdash; A.C.T., The Eureka Theatre, The Magic Theatre in San Francisco, the New Playwright’s Theatre in Washington, the Beverly Hills Playhouse and both the Finborough Theatre and the New Arts Theatre in London, UK.

## Manu Moreau
Well acquainted with our Brussels crowd, Manu Moreau could be a bird or a plane. Well, if he’s up that high, he must be insane! From a small township to the big city, he’s been there, done that and sold the t-shirt. His first steps in comedy weren’t so long ago, but every step since has been closely monitored for your safety. His comedy works similar to cocaine: one line after the other, very addictive...

## Sergej Lopouchanski
The very first comrade of comedy in Belgium will not only make you laugh, but he will also insist that you laugh! After escaping the cold of Mother Russia, he finds his way to warm your hearts with his endearing smile. As he takes the comedy world by storm, who are we to resist him taking over our stage?
