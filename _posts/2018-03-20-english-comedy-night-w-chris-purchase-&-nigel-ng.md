Continuing our journey of comedy discoveries, here are two comedy gems that are taking the UK circuit by storm at the moment. Check them out!

## Chris Purchase

Fresh from a sell out run of his new show ‘Distracted’ at Dave’s Leicester Comedy Festival, being a finalist for What’s On magazine’s Best Comedian 2016, 2017 and 2018, finalist out of 20,000 comedians for the Laugh Factory’s international joke of the year 2017 and recently hand-picked to support Reginald D. Hunter on tour Chris is currently taking the comedy scene by storm with his mix of light hearted anecdotes and cultural satire. After going viral multiple times last year Chris’ popularity has rocketed. Chris is also massively popular with corporate clients including hosting Google’s European conferences.

“Charismatic and entertaining” - Comedy Central

“Had the crowd roaring, lapped it up . Full of energy, loud, charismatic. Lovely.” - The Stand

“Top stuff...confident, funny and self deprecating” - Jack Whitehall

“Fantastic Set” - Adam Bloom

"That is a nice tie" - Reginald D Hunter

## Nigel NG

Nigel Ng grew up in Malaysia, lived in America for five years and moved to the UK in 2015. Having started his comedy career in Chicago, he’s relieved that (most) people in the UK get his jokes too, as evidenced by him winning the prestigious Amused Moose Laugh Off 2016 and being runner up in the Laughing Horse New Act of the Year 2015.

Nigel was the winner of the Amused Moose Comedy Laugh Off 2016 and the finalist of many other prestigious comedy competitions such as Laughing Horse New Act of the Year 2015, Leicester Mercury Comedian of the Year 2016 and Leicester Square New Comedian of the Year 2015.

His combination of laid back likability and sharp observations are sure to get him far.

He was also a finalist in the Leicester Mercury Comedian of the Year (2016) and Leicester Square New Comedian of the Year (2015) competitions, and now can be seen performing in comedy clubs across the UK.
