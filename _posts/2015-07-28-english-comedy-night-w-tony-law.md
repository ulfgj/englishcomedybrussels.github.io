Here's another fantastic line up for our August show

You loved him last year, surreal canadian comedian Tony Law is back !!

### Tony Law (CAN)
Tony is a unique stand-up comedian, who looks like a cross between a 1908 Olympic athlete and – his words – a 16th century Genoese sailor. His TV appearances include "Never Mind The Buzzcocks", Stewart Lee’s "Comedy Vehicle" and "Have I Got News For You". He is known for his highly surreal material and delivery, and 1950s Americana style of dress, favouring boots with turned-up jeans and a Viking/explorer style of hair.
