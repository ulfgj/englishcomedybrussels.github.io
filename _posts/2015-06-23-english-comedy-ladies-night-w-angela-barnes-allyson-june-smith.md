### Angela Barnes
She has won the 2011 BBC New Comedy Award and became a finalist at the 2011 Latitude Festival New Act of the Year competition. Since 2011, Angela and her witty world view have been catapulted onto numerous radio and television shows including appearances on BBC Three's Russell Howard's Good News, Russell Kane's Whistle Stop Tour (BBC Radio 2), and BBC Radio 4's The Now Show.

“Brilliantly funny” &mdash; *Sarah Millican*

“She's just a gloriously down-to-earth, straight talking and extremely funny comic” &mdash; *The Guardian*

“Angela Barnes is the best mainstream female comedian I've seen since Sarah Millican… I can't be any clearer than that can I?” &mdash; *Bruce Dessau, Evening Standard critic*

### Allyson June Smith
Since 2000, Allyson June Smith has been tickling Canada’s comedy scene
from the moment she put down the chalk brush and picked up a mic.
Playing to packed rooms has become like another day in the classroom
for this former school teacher.

Her credits include her own hour long Comedy Now special, appearances on
CBC Radio’s hit show The Debaters, and the Winnipeg, Halifax and Just For Laughs Festivals, to name just a few. A multiple Canadian Comedy Award nominee for Best Female Stand-Up, she performs for audiences ranging from corporations to the most rural of gatherings. Whether she was the emcee, support, or headliner, she's delighted them all.

After working her way across Canada, Allyson now has taken her craft to the UK. Using her sassy blend of in-your-face stand-up and hilariously insightful commentary, she now works for major UK promoters and comedy clubs.

It is her genuine and unique sense of humor, combined with excellent performance
timing, that has made audiences laugh. This teacher-come-comic is ready to show international audiences why she is a sought-after fan favourite.
