## Rayguns Look Real Enough (GB)

"Spinal Tap meets Morcambe and wise, with the comedy circuit's most unique double-act. The self proclaimed "World's Greatest Stadium Rock Band features Ray Gunn and Luke Reel as they reveal what it takes to be a Rock 'n' Roll Superstar. Combining character comedy with high energy musical mash-ups, Rayguns Look Real Enough are not to be missed."

"My favourite opening act" &mdash; Steve O - Jackass

"Fast and Funny" &mdash; The List

"The British answer to Tenacious D but way funnier" &mdash; Broadway Baby
