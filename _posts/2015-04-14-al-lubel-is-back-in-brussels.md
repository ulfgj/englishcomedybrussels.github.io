Good news, the great Al Lubel is back in Brussels on april the 14th.

If you missed him before, make sure you don't this time. If you've seen him before, I know you'll be back.

Al Lubel appeared 5 times on the David Letterman show, toured with Bill Hicks and Jerry Seinfeld, who says of him 'He has one of the best jokes I ever heard'.

It's great to have him performing at The Black Sheep this time.

As a special guest for this evening, we'll have argentinian comedian Adrián Minkowicz, who already did many shows abroad with Al Lubel.

Make sure you get your tickets in advance !

Here's a video to give you an idea :-)
